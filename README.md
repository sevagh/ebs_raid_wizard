### Attach EBS volumes and ENIs to running EC2 instances

`goat` is a Go application which runs from inside the EC2 instance.

By setting your tags correctly, `goat` can discover and attach EBS volumes and ENIs. Furthermore, for EBS volumes, it can perform additional actions such as RAID (with mdadm), mkfs, and mount EBS volumes to the EC2 instance where it's running.

The `goat` package consists of the subcommands [goat ebs](./docs/EBS.md) and [goat eni](./docs/ENI.md).

### Permission model

It's necessary for the instance to have an IAM Role with _at least_ access to the EBS and ENI resources that it will be attaching - see [here](./docs/hcl-example/iam_role.tf). Your roles can be even more permissive (i.e. full EC2 access) but that comes with its own risks.

Unfortunately, resource-level permissions are [currently not supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ec2-api-permissions.html#ec2-api-unsupported-resource-permissions) for attaching network interfaces. This means that to use `goat@eni`, your instances must have full permissions for __all__ ENIs.

### Install and run

Goat is a Go binary that should be able to run on any Linux instance.

In the releases tab you can find a zip of the binary, and a `.deb` and `.rpm` package with systemd support generated by [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm).

To use goat, run it during the launch process of your EC2 instance - you can `systemctl enable goat@TARGET` and `systemctl start goat@TARGET` (where TARGET is one of ebs or eni).

It's a Linux-specific tool which needs `mdadm` to work for the RAID features.

#### Usage

In the most basic case, you should run `goat ebs` or `goat eni`.

Full usage:

```
Usage: goat [OPTIONS] ebs|eni

OPTIONS
  -debug
        Interactive debug prompts
  -logLevel string
        Log level (default "info")
  -tagPrefix string
        Prefix for GOAT related tags (default "GOAT-IN")
  -version
        Display version and exit
```

### Environment variables

You can use the environment variables:

* `GOAT_LOG_LEVEL`
* `GOAT_TAG_PREFIX`

Set these the same as `-logLevel` and `-tagPrefix` -  the environment variables take precedence.

### Additional dependencies for ENI

Goat by itself is sufficient for the EBS feature, but needs help for setting up an ENI. Refer to [this](./docs/ENI.md#setting-up-the-eni---ec2-net-utils) document.

### Hack

If you have docker locally, you can use the following command in order to quickly get a development env ready: `make dev-env`.
